pstack is © Lauren Tan, MIT; this port is MIT too (see [License and credit](#license-and-credit)).

A Claude Code port of [pstack](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/tree/main/pstack), Lauren Tan's
Cursor plugin of agent workflows, kept in step with upstream. Type `/pstack:poteto-mode` with a
task, an issue or a spec: pstack picks a playbook (Feature, Bug fix, Refactoring, Orchestrate…),
runs it with parallel workers and review panels, and opens the PRs. It runs the same way on your
machine and in a Claude Code cloud session.

## Install (local)

**Prerequisites**
- Claude Code 2.1.294 or later, the version CI validates the plugin with.
- `gh`, signed in.
- **Bun, or Node ≥ 22.18**, for orchestrate, babysitting PRs, shipping and multi-phase plans.
  Without one, those steps stop and print the install line; the rest of pstack runs.

**Install**

```
/plugin marketplace add janrizmlibres/claude-pstack
/plugin install pstack@claude-pstack
```

**Turn on auto-update.** Claude Code leaves it off for third-party marketplaces: `/plugin` →
Marketplaces → `claude-pstack` → Enable auto-update. Every merge to `main` is a release, so
without auto-update you stay on the commit you installed. `/plugin` shows a commit SHA, not a
version number; the upstream version you're on is the line at the top of this README.

**The `Read` rule** (default permission mode only). pstack's skills read each other by path from
the plugin cache. In default mode those reads prompt you, and a subagent's are denied. Add one
rule to `permissions.allow` in your user settings, `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": ["Read(~/.claude/plugins/cache/claude-pstack/**)"]
  }
}
```

Auto mode needs nothing, and the cloud setup line adds its own rule.

**Pick models** (optional): `/config` → pstack, or `/plugin configure pstack@claude-pstack`. Each
setting takes `opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku` or `fable`; an unconfigured install runs on the defaults.

| Setting | Runs | Default | Effort (fixed) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Work | code delegates, arena runners, sub-leads | `opus` | medium |
| Judgement | judges, reviewers, the hardest tasks | `opus` | high |
| Volume | swarm and race workers, bulk readers | `sonnet` | high |

`/pstack:setup-pstack` shows your current settings and prints the cloud setup line filled in with
them.

**Worktrees.** A local run gives each parallel code-writing worker its own git worktree under
`.claude/worktrees/` (arena and architect runners, prototypes, figure-it-out and visual-parity
workers), and each PR works from a worktree off its base, `develop` or any other. Your own
checkout is left alone.
- Worktrees hold tracked files only. List the gitignored files workers need, such as `.env`, in a
  `.worktreeinclude` at your repo root. A worker missing one stops with `BLOCKED: missing <file>`
  rather than copying it.
- `worktree.symlinkDirectories` (for `node_modules`, say) is yours to opt into. pstack never sets
  it, since one worktree's install would then change every other's.
- Worktrees cost disk. The lead removes workers' worktrees once their work is integrated and keeps
  the branches; ask for "worktree cleanup" to reclaim strays.

## Cloud workers from a local run

A local lead sends **swarm workers, orchestrate units and autopilot owners** to Claude Code cloud
sessions by default. That needs:
1. **Auto mode** on your account: the lead starts cloud workers with
   `claude --cloud --permission-mode auto`. Any other mode would stop on a click per worker.
2. A **default cloud environment** that carries the setup line (next section), since cloud workers
   launch there. Pick it with `/remote-env`, which saves it to your user settings.

Say **"local only"** in a request to keep everything on your machine: the big fan-outs then run
in parallel local worktrees. If the lead can't start cloud workers, it falls back to local only
and says so once.

## Install (cloud)

The cloud surface has no `/plugin`, so pstack gets there through the environment's **Setup
script**. Paste this **setup line** into it, or copy it from `/pstack:setup-pstack`, which fills
in your model settings:

```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/janrizmlibres/claude-pstack /opt/claude-pstack && bash /opt/claude-pstack/scripts/cloud-install.sh --config work_model=opus --config judgement_model=opus --config volume_model=sonnet
```

It installs the plugin, lets subagents nest three deep, adds the `Read` rule, installs Chromium for
browser checks on a best-effort basis (setup still finishes if the download fails), and adds a
session-start hook that pulls the latest pstack, so cloud sessions stay current without your
editing the line. Changing a model means editing the line.

- Put the line in **every environment that should carry pstack.**
- **One environment per repo**, if you keep one for each project: set
  `"remote": { "defaultEnvironmentId": "<env_ id>" }` in that repo's `.claude/settings.local.json`.
  Pick it once with `/remote-env`, then move the key there from `~/.claude/settings.json`; local
  settings outrank user settings. `claude --cloud` and a local lead's cloud workers then use it in
  that repo without your naming it each run.
- Turn on the repo's **Automatically delete head branches** setting. A cloud session can't delete
  branches or change repo settings; with it on, merged heads go and open stacked PRs are
  retargeted. Whatever a run leaves behind is listed in its final reply, with one delete line to
  run locally.

## Running it

```
/pstack:poteto-mode fix the flaky retry test in src/net
/pstack:poteto-mode build #42
```

**Run a spec in the cloud.** Plan locally (with `/to-spec`, for instance), then start a cloud
session with:

```
/pstack:poteto-mode build https://github.com/<you>/<repo>/issues/42
```

- Handing pstack a spec is the go to **execute** it: it posts its plan on the spec's issue (or an
  orphan branch, for a spec that isn't an issue) and carries on. Say **"plan only"** to stop once
  the plan is posted.
- **Landing (merging) stays with you** unless the request grants it ("…and land it").
- **"Hand this off"** in a local run passes it to a cloud lead and ends with the session link. If
  the hand-off fails, the run stays local and says why once.

### From a routine

A routine whose prompt starts with `/pstack:poteto-mode` runs as a full cloud lead.
- Set the routine up with your repo and an environment that carries the setup line. Its workers
  run as subagents in the routine's own VM; it needs no connector.
- Set or check the routine's model with `/schedule`: the claude.ai form may not save its pick.
- A task written into the prompt (fired on a schedule, or with Run now) needs nothing more. For an
  **API or GitHub firing**, the input arrives as the next message, so the prompt has to wait for
  it:

  ```
  /pstack:poteto-mode build the PR in the trigger context. It arrives as the next message: end this turn without acting until it does.
  ```

- Label events on draft PRs may not fire.
- A GitHub-fired run starts at the PR's head, on a `claude/` branch of its own.
- The run pushes like any cloud lead, and landing stays withheld unless the prompt grants it.

## What a run costs

A Feature can run up to three panels:

| Panel | Workers |
|---|---|
| architect (an arena) | 3 Work runners + 1 Judgement judge |
| implementation arena | 3 Work runners + 1 Judgement judge |
| interrogate | 3 Judgement reviewers |

On the default settings that is up to **11 Opus workers** for one Feature, plus the lead. Most bug
fixes run no panel. To spend less, waive a panel in the request ("skip the arena") or in your
`CLAUDE.md`; the run records it as `skip: user waived`. pstack never skips one on its own.

Heavy commands (tests, builds, whole-project typechecks, dev servers, browsers) run **one at a
time per machine**, across every pstack session on it, so a wide fan-out is bounded by your test
and build time, not by the number of workers.

## Your rules win

Your request and your `CLAUDE.md` outrank pstack's text, its Non-negotiables included: commit
attribution, TDD, merge method, PR title style, test caps. pstack's defaults (squash merges,
Conventional Commits, hand-chained stacks) apply only where you say nothing. To use `gh stack` for
stacked PRs, for example, say so in your `CLAUDE.md`.

In cloud, your user-level `CLAUDE.md` isn't there: rules come from the request and the repo's own
`CLAUDE.md`.

## How the port differs

- **Claude models only.** Upstream mixes model families for breadth. The port gets breadth from
  distinct prompts instead: arena runners each build a different direction, plus one runner
  that looks outside them all, and interrogate's reviewers split the rubric into lenses. Judges and
  reviewers get fresh context, never the reasoning they judge.
- **Three settings, not a per-role model map.** Work, Judgement and Volume, [above](#install-local).
- **No Cursor dependencies.** Cursor's CLI, modes, Bugbot and Origin are replaced or dropped;
  review-bot triage covers any review bot, and `gh` is the only forge.
- **Cloud is a second surface.** Upstream sends big fan-outs to Cursor cloud agents; the port sends
  the same ones to Claude Code cloud sessions under Auto, and a whole run can start in cloud.
- **Added by the port:** the cloud setup line, the per-turn reminder hook, recovery after context
  compaction, the machine lock on heavy commands, and the hand-off playbook.
- **Left out:** `automations/benny` (Cursor Slack automations), external models, and native mobile
  verification.

### File by file

<!-- BEGIN generated from port.json — do not edit by hand -->
| File | Kind | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `skills/architect/SKILL.md` | override | Phase B's two distinct candidates come from arena's directions, the architect runners model line goes, and a spec's Implementation Decisions reach every runner as fixed constraints |
| `skills/architect/references/runner-prompt.md` | override | arena's directed or fourth-way block replaces the each-on-a-different-model paragraph, and a spec's Implementation Decisions bind every shape |
| `skills/arena/SKILL.md` | override | runners on Work with two whole-shape directions, a fourth-way seat and their escapes, and a blind judge on every arena, in place of a runner per model family and a cross-family judge |
| `skills/poteto-help/SKILL.md` | override | Cursor-only sections (Custom Mode, Option+Enter, .cursor/rules, /add-plugin) rewritten for Claude Code's install, settings and surfaces, with a row for re-entering the mode after a resume |
| `skills/poteto-mode/scripts/check-plan.mjs` | override | its markers match the port's plan wording: live lanes on the `volume` agent instead of a named model, and playbooks read from the plugin instead of from trunk with `git show` |
| `skills/setup-pstack/SKILL.md` | override | shows the three settings, points to /config, prints the setup line and shows the Read rule, in place of writing a Cursor model rule |
| `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` | port-only | Claude Code's plugin manifest, with the three model settings as userConfig and no version |
| `agents/judgement-reader.md` | port-only | the Judgement setting's reader, in place of a readonly generalPurpose spawn: no Edit, Write or NotebookEdit, high effort |
| `agents/judgement.md` | port-only | the Judgement setting's writer: upstream's poteto-agent body on the Judgement default model at high effort, in the background |
| `agents/volume-reader.md` | port-only | the Volume setting's reader, in place of a readonly generalPurpose spawn: no Edit, Write or NotebookEdit, high effort |
| `agents/volume.md` | port-only | the Volume setting's writer: upstream's poteto-agent body on the Volume default model at high effort, in the background |
| `agents/work-reader.md` | port-only | the Work setting's reader, in place of a readonly generalPurpose spawn: no Edit, Write or NotebookEdit, medium effort |
| `agents/work.md` | port-only | the Work setting's writer: upstream's poteto-agent body on the Work default model at medium effort, in the background |
| `hooks/hooks.json` | port-only | registers the compaction hook on SessionStart's compact matcher, which skill frontmatter can't: its SessionStart never fires |
| `hooks/poteto-mode-compaction.sh` | port-only | after a compaction in a marked poteto-mode session, lists the durable state to re-read before acting: the skill, any store, the transcript, a trail and a resume note |
| `hooks/poteto-mode-reminder.sh` | port-only | poteto-mode's per-turn reminder hook: upstream's reminder text, the skill path, the surface and mode, precedence and the machine lock, and the session marker the compaction hook reads |
| `scripts/heavy` | port-only | the machine lock: runs one heavy command at a time per machine, released by the kernel when its holder dies |
| `skills/poteto-mode/playbooks/hand-off.md` | port-only | the Hand-off playbook: on an explicit request only, pushes the input, starts a cloud lead with `claude --cloud --permission-mode auto` and a fixed brief, then prints the link and ends, or says why once and stays local |
| `skills/poteto-mode/references/brief-contract.md` | port-only | the rules every worker brief carries: entry line, no human asks, own-branch pushes, start commit, the machine lock, missing files, leaf workers, the trailered report commit and a sub-lead's timebox |
| `skills/poteto-mode/scripts/node_modules/commander/` | port-only | commander 14.0.0, the version upstream's bun.lock pins, vendored with its MIT licence so upstream's imports resolve without an install |
| `skills/poteto-mode/scripts/run` | port-only | the runtime launcher: runs poteto-mode's scripts with Bun, else Node 22.18+, in place of bootstrap.ts's install |
| `agents/poteto-agent.md` | dropped | replaced by the three writer agents, which carry its body |
| `automations/benny/` | dropped | Cursor Slack automations, outside the port's scope |
| `skills/make-bot-ui/` | dropped | Cursor Grok Bot automations: the session creates its own webhook routine and wakes on it, and a lead creating its own routines is out of the port's scope |
| `skills/poteto-mode/scripts/bootstrap.ts` | dropped | installs commander at first run; the port vendors commander and runs scripts through its launcher |
| `skills/poteto-mode/scripts/bun.lock` | dropped | a runtime lockfile for bootstrap.ts's install; kept for development only |
| `skills/poteto-mode/scripts/package.json` | dropped | a runtime manifest for bootstrap.ts's install; kept for development only |

Every other file is translated from upstream at the same path, except `skills/control-cli/` (from `cursor-team-kit/skills/control-cli/`), `skills/control-ui/` (from `cursor-team-kit/skills/control-ui/`) and `skills/deslop/` (from `cursor-team-kit/skills/deslop/`).

## Keeping up with upstream

A weekly GitHub Action checks upstream. When it has moved, Claude opens one sync PR that brings the
port up to date, with a row per upstream change and ⚠️ on the calls it was unsure of. Nothing
merges itself. The snapshot, upstream's verbatim copy, lives in `upstream/`, and the sync re-renders the
version line and file table above. `CONTEXT.md` and `docs/adr/` explain the port's vocabulary and
decisions.
