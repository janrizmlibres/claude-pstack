# Sync upstream

Two modes, one PR each. Vocabulary is `CONTEXT.md`'s.

- **Sync** (`/sync-upstream [dry run] [ref]`, ref default `main`): carry what upstream changed since the snapshot into the port, then advance the snapshot.
- **Re-translation** (`/sync-upstream retranslate <rule>`): carry a changed conversion rule into every translated file it touches. The snapshot stays where it is.

The sources of truth: `docs/conversion-rules.md` (every rule, applied to every file you translate), `port.json` (each file's kind; an unlisted `pstack/` file is a translated file of its counterpart under `upstream/`), and the scripts under `scripts/`, each documented in its header. The base branch is the branch checked out when you start. `<scratch>` is `.git/sync-upstream/` (create it): inside the checkout, never committed.

The weekly workflow runs this skill with no one watching, and you may be running unattended too. Settle every call yourself: make the best call, mark its row ⚠️ and say why in the row's Reason. The PR is where the maintainer reviews.

## Sync

1. **Pin upstream.** Run `bun scripts/sync-changes.ts [ref] > <scratch>/changes.md`. Its first line names upstream's commit and pstack version; that commit is the target for the whole run, even if upstream moves meanwhile. "Nothing to sync" ends the run: say so and stop. A **dry run** ends here too: print the table and stop, with no branch, no edits and no PR.
2. **Branch.** `git switch -c sync/<version>` from the base. If `sync/<version>` already exists on `origin`, use `sync/<version>-<first 7 of the commit>`.
3. **Read the change and its intent.** Run `bun scripts/upstream-diff.ts <commit> > <scratch>/upstream.diff` now, while the snapshot still holds the old side. Read intent from upstream's commit messages and PR bodies: for each snapshot path, `gh api "repos/cursor/plugins/commits?sha=<commit>&path=<path>&per_page=100"`, down to the snapshot's commit, then `gh api repos/cursor/plugins/commits/<sha>/pulls` for each commit's PR. Intent decides how a change lands in the port; the diff only says what moved.
4. **Carry every row.** The table has one row per upstream change and port file it reaches, with the kind and the action. Do each action under these rules:
   - **Translated file changed:** patch the port file forward, applying the conversion rules to the new hunks. When upstream mostly rewrote the file, re-translate it whole from the new counterpart; the Reason says "re-translated" or "patched".
   - **Override changed, or a file in its `depends_on` changed:** edit the override as its intent requires. The Reason records the call: **absorbed**, **partly absorbed** or **ignored**, and why. The override's body carries no sync notes.
   - **New file:** translate it at its path by default. Propose it as an override or as dropped instead, with a one-line `why` in a new `port.json` entry, when a translation can't serve it.
   - **Deleted file:** delete its translated file. Propose deleting an override, or keep it by changing its entry to `port-only` (removing `sources` and `depends_on`). Remove a dropped entry that no longer covers anything.
   - **Renamed file:** `git mv` the port file and move its `port.json` entry, repointing every `sources` and `depends_on` that named the old path; then patch forward any edits.
   - **Dropped file changed:** listed only, collapsed below the table as the script prints it.
   - **⚠️ rows** (an upstream file at a port-only or vendored path, a rename across kinds): decide, do it, and keep the ⚠️.
   - **Upstream's `commander` pin moved:** re-copy the vendored `pstack/skills/poteto-mode/scripts/node_modules/commander` at the new version, licence included.

   Done when every row's action is carried out and its Reason is filled.
5. **Fan out above a handful of files.** When more than 5 rows need edits, spawn one subagent per skill directory (`pstack/skills/<name>/`; other files grouped by their top directory under `pstack/`), all in one message. Keep overrides and `skills/poteto-mode/SKILL.md` in this session, on Opus. Give small translated hunks to `model: "sonnet"` and full re-translations to `model: "opus"`. Each brief holds that directory's rows, their hunks of `upstream.diff`, the intent you read, the path to `docs/conversion-rules.md`, and the rule that it edits only files in its directory. Each subagent returns its rows with Reasons filled and its ⚠️ calls. Read what comes back before step 7.
6. **Propose a missing rule.** When a change needs a Claude Code form that no conversion rule gives, make the best call in the file and add the rule to `docs/conversion-rules.md` in this PR, in the document's own format: prose, then a `detect` block with `before` and `after` lines, or `undetectable:` with the reason. Mark the row ⚠️ and name the new rule.
7. **Advance the snapshot.** `bun scripts/upstream-snapshot.ts <commit>`, the pinned commit, never `main`.
8. **Run the checks**, each to exit 0, fixing the port until it does:
   - `bun scripts/upstream-diff.ts --verify`
   - `bun scripts/check-cursorisms.ts`
   - `bun scripts/check-port-json.ts`
   - `bun scripts/render-readme.ts`, then `bun scripts/render-readme.ts --check`
9. **Open the PR.** Commit `upstream/`, `pstack/`, `port.json`, the README and any rules edit together, with a plain message (`Sync upstream pstack v<version>`) and no attribution lines. Push the branch, then `gh pr create --base <base> --title "Sync upstream pstack v<version>" --body-file <scratch>/body.md`. The body:
   - the script's first line (upstream's commit and version, since the snapshot's);
   - a few lines of upstream's intent, from step 3;
   - the table with every Reason filled, ⚠️ rows kept, and the dropped-files block below it;
   - the files re-translated whole, the rules proposed, and any check you couldn't get to exit 0, with its output.

   Done when the PR is open; reply with its link.

## Re-translation

1. **Name the rule.** `<rule>` is a rule's number or title in `docs/conversion-rules.md`, as it reads on the base branch.
2. **Find every translated file it touches.** The translated files are the `pstack/` files `port.json` doesn't list as override, port-only or dropped. A rule with a `detect` block finds them: `bun scripts/check-cursorisms.ts` lists every leftover line. For an `undetectable` rule, or a rule whose scope widened past its patterns, search the counterparts under `upstream/` for the mechanic the rule converts. Done when every translated file is either on the list or known not to carry the mechanic.
3. **Branch.** `git switch -c retranslate/<rule-slug>` from the base.
4. **Re-apply the rule.** For each listed file, apply the rule as it now reads, from the counterpart's text, leaving the rest of the file as it is. Fan out as in step 5 of Sync. Overrides are hand-written: an override the rule bears on gets a ⚠️ row, never an edit.
5. **Run the checks** of Sync step 8. The snapshot doesn't move: `git diff --stat <base> -- upstream/` must print nothing.
6. **Open the PR** as in Sync step 9, titled `Re-translate for rule <n>: <title>`, its body a row per file (port file · lines changed · Reason) and the ⚠️ override rows.
